## Loan Credit Risk Prediction - ML Model using Random Forest Algorithm

As a part of the final project in Rakamin & ID/X Partner Virtual Internship, I with a role of Data Scientist had to build a model to predit loan credit risk of a bank/lender.

Programming language used: Python

This project consisted of several steps:
1. Problem Statement - Loan credit risk problem - which one should we reject or approve?
2. Problem Approach - Building a ML model based on the dataset to predict which one we should reject or approve.
3. Data Gathering - The data was provided by Rakamin & ID/X Partner
4. Data Wrangling:
	- Data Cleaning
	- Feature Selection
5. Exploratory Data Analysis
6. Feature Engineering
	- Check outliers
	- Check Duplication
	- Tranformation
	- Imputation
	- Feature Selection
7. Modeling
	- Baseline Model
	- Algorithm used: Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN
	- Hyperparameters Tuning - GridSearchCV
8. Final Model - retraining for final model used
9. Build a web app - Check it [here](https://loan-credit-risk-streamlit.herokuapp.com/) for repo you could check it [here](https://github.com/IchfanKurniawan/loan-credit-risk-streamlit)

Libraries used in this project were:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Matplotlib
4. Seaborn
5. SMOTE
6. Sklearn
7. Streamlit
8. Joblib
